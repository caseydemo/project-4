# Villain Mail

A villains-only messages application.

## Installation

1. Clone source code

2. Create a database

3. Create .env and add database credentials

4. Run migrations

## End of the day
- accomplished MVP
- after much forhead banging, I made a form that saves to a database!!!

TODO
- still want to make a reply system (worked on that for a while)
- want to make improved indication if mail has been read or not
- more customization for each villain's style
